# ðŸ”¥ DLL Injection CTF Challenge ðŸ”¥

Welcome to the ultimate DLL Injection Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge!

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Overview

Youâ€™ve been handed a running Windows program called `victim_app.exe`. Your mission? Inject a custom DLL payload into this target process to unlock a hidden secret â€” a secret flag!

This challenge is designed to push your Windows internals and penetration testing skills to the limit. You wonâ€™t get the payload DLL upfront; instead, you must craft or discover your own DLL to inject. Once successfully injected, the payload will reveal the flag either via a popup message box or by writing it to a file named `flag.txt`.

## ðŸ§© What Youâ€™ll Get

- `victim_app.exe` â€” The target application running on Windows.
- `injector.py` â€” A sample Python injector script to kickstart your exploration (optional).
- `README.md` â€” This guide and challenge instructions.

**Note:** The flag-carrying DLL (`flag_dll.dll`) is intentionally **not** provided. Creating or sourcing your own DLL is part of the challenge!

## ðŸ”¥ Your Objectives

1. Analyze the running `victim_app.exe` process.
2. Use DLL injection techniques to load your custom DLL into the target process.
3. Trigger the DLL to reveal the hidden flag.
4. Capture the flag and submit your payload DLL along with a write-up detailing your approach.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- Explore common Windows DLL injection methods like `CreateRemoteThread`, `SetWindowsHookEx`, or APC injection.
- Use powerful tools like **Process Explorer**, **Process Hacker**, or debuggers such as **x64dbg** or **WinDbg** to study the victim process.
- Modify and improve the provided `injector.py` or write your own injector from scratch.
- Look out for clues within the victim application that might help your DLL execute properly.

Good luck, hacker! Show your skills and uncover the flag hidden deep within the process memory! ðŸš€
